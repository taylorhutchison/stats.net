# Stats.Net
## A Statistics Library for .NET Core.

Stats.Net is a brand new project started in February 2017. It is just a pet project and I plan to grow it slowly. My goal is learn more about statistics by building this library. I am not taking contributors, but I do appreciate feedback. 

My roadmap of features includes:
- Documentation
- Data Distribution Analysis
- Linear Regression
- Cluster Analysis
- Read data from Excel and LibreOffice Calc spreadsheets
- Output to web-friendly format (likely D3)
